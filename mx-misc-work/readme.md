# MISC NOTES    

If you find yourself in this folder, there is really nothing to see here. As I build the course,
I often experiment with different demos and code snippets.  This is where I put them.  

You are welcome to look around. There are demos like analog clocks, and other things that are not part of the course.  They are just here for fun.  Enjoy!

* Note: no guarantees anything in this folder works
